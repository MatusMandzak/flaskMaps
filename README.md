# DPMK Tracking
> flask based program to track public transportation on map in KE

A python program, that uses publicly accessible GPS data to track buses and trams in my Ko≈°ice, Slovakia.

## About

Simple python app built on Flask framework, that tracks buses and trams. GPS information is gathered from publicly open DPMK API.

App is inspired by https://mhdke.sk from NoLimit|DEVELOPERS, check them out on their [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/101041385188593).

I built this app to learn Flask, JS and primarly [Leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com).
